You just have to be interested in either motivating people to be somewhere or in getting credit for being there.</div>

        <div class="Answers BabyBlue"><strong>A.</strong> The Maps page and all the Layers pages contain social media icons on the bottom right that will allow you to share that page

        <div class="Answers BabyBlue"><strong>A.</strong> Yes and No.  Some markers require you to be close enough to the marker's designated address before you can complete the task.  Other's allow check-in from anywhere.  It varies from marker to marker.</div>

        <div onClick="expandcontent('sc3g')" class="Questions"><strong>Q.</strong> I lost my password, how do I retreive it?</div>

        <div onClick="expandcontent('sc4b')" class="Questions"><strong>Q.</strong> The vendor tells me that they didn't offer the marker, but their location is clearly where the promo took place. What's up?</div>
        <div id="sc4b" class="switchcontent" style="margin:5px 25px 5px 15px;">
        <div class="Answers BabyBlue"><strong>A.</strong> On the marker details page, check the username of the account who created the marker.  It's located at the very bottom.  This is the 
        account who should honor the marker, not necessarily the vendor at the location where the marker is located.  Remember, since markers can be created anywhere, a marker that is 
        located somewhere may not necessarily be associated with that vendor.  There will be a "verified" icon next to vendors that have paid us to verify their authenticity.  </div>
